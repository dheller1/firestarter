## Firestarter ##

A small tool acting as a launcher for games and track the time spent playing, comparable to [Steam](http://steampowered.com). You can also connect FireStarter with your Steam account, allowing to compare games tracked in FireStarter to those tracked in Steam.

FireStarter is implemented with [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro).

Some [Screenshots](Screenshots.md) are available.

Currently Windows-only, but there are only a few platform dependent features (icon loading, process id query), so feel free to drop these and use any OS.

FireStarter is still in early development status and receives updates infrequently. Use at your own risk.
